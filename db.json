      "description": "Unless you are already a diligent journaler during trips, you are probably forgetting most of what you did on your last voyage abroad (you know it's true!). And yes, photographs can help you remember quite a bit, but we all know that there are plenty of activities that aren't conducive to cameras, times when we leave them at home, and feelings that a camera just can't capture. Do you want to just lose those moments forever?\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned after years of travel writing (and plenty of travel that never became an article), it's that I can hardly remember the glorious details of the latter. I'm willing to bet that the same could be said for your own memories. (A prime example is Paul over at TravMonkey--he just made a beautiful video of his voyage to Menorca--but had to call his mom to find out if he'd been there before! Turns out he had, but didn't remember).\n\nSo before you pack your bags for your next voyage, you should start a travel blog. Not to make money, and not get a million people to follow you, but for yourself, and maybe for other people you know. Many non-bloggers don't realize that you can blog without it being a big deal--you can do it just for fun. Because you can't film every minute of your voyages (nor should you try), but you can make a commitment to sit down every evening (or wake a few minutes earlier every morning) and get down your still-fresh memories from the day before while you are traveling."

      "description": "It all started as a normal day in the life of a flight attendant based in Miami. It was a hot summer day, high humidity with salty air blowing in the 100-degree heat. My pantyhose felt like they were melting into my skin. I made it off the employee shuttle, through security, checking in on my tablet while trying to look like a rockstar working the terminal. The boarding process wasn’t so bad that day. Sometimes it’s pretty chaotic, as I am sure some of you well-traveled folks are aware of. Everyone boarded, the doors closed and we were ready to go — or so I thought. Suddenly I received a call to the front of the plane: “Uh, hey, we can’t leave, we have someone who is stuck inside the toilet.”I sent a fellow flight attendant to the back to see exactly what was going on. Sure enough, there was someone wedged into the toilet. We were trying to be as inconspicuous as possible…which was not working. We tried pulling on the passenger’s arms, but nothing worked. We finally came to the realization that we needed maintenance. We also called the captain, who didn’t believe what was happening, so he came back from the cockpit to check it out for himself. He got an eyeful.\n\nThe whole ordeal resulted in a two-hour delay. Needless to say, the other passengers were not thrilled, and per usual they were taking it out on the flight attendants. How could I explain to an airplane full of 134 people that someone was stuck on our toilet because they had flushed while still seated and the suction wedged them in? Maintenance came to the rescue and detached the toilet head, which freed the passenger. As humiliating as this was for the passenger, we as flight attendants were speechless. So, to anyone reading this, please remember one thing: Do not flush the toilet on an airplane while you’re still sitting on it "
